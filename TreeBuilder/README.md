TreeBuilder
====================

# Purpose

This is a script to randomly generate a large number of phylogenetic trees
using WALS and Ethnologue data.  It relies on a number of third party libraries
which are also included here, for ease of distributing this entire project as
a single, self-contained working pile of code.

Detailed documentation to appear (famous last words!)...
